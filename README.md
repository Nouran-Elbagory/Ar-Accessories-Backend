# Acessorize Backend

Welcome to the Acessorize backend repository!
Acessorize is an e-commerce application that allows users to try on face accessories before making a purchase. 
This repository contains the backend code for the Acessorize project, which is primarily developed using Node.js and JavaScript.

## Features

**Try-On Feature**: Acessorize offers a unique try-on feature that enables users to virtually try on face accessories before making a purchase. 
This feature utilizes 3D models and allows users to visualize how the accessory will look on their face.

## Technologies Used

The Acessorize backend leverages the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: The backend is primarily built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows for scalable and efficient server-side applications.

- **Firebase Cloud Storage**: We have integrated Firebase Cloud Storage to securely store the 3D models used for the try-on feature. This ensures that the models are easily accessible and can be retrieved when needed.

- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is utilized to enable secure communication between the backend server and the frontend application, allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend.

- **Token-based Authentication**: We have implemented token-based authentication to protect endpoints after the user logs in. This ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities and data.

## Modules

The backend is divided into three main modules: 
- Admin 
- Seller  
- User
Each module focuses on different operations and functionalities. Here's a brief overview of each module:
